Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm that emulates the hunting behavior and social hierarchy of grey wolves. This optimization technique is based on the observation that grey wolves exhibit intelligent hunting strategies and cooperation within their packs. GWO comprises a population of candidate solutions represented as a pack of grey wolves. The algorithm imitates the hierarchical structure and dynamics of the pack, consisting of alpha, beta, delta, and omega wolves representing the best solutions found so far. The search process in GWO involves four main stages: encircling, hunting, attacking, and updating. In the encircling stage, the alpha wolf leads the pack to encircle the prey's potential location. This helps to explore the solution space and locate promising regions. During the hunting stage, the grey wolves search for the prey by adjusting their positions based on the alpha, beta, and delta wolves' leadership. This cooperative behavior facilitates information exchange and effective exploration of the solution space. In the attacking stage, the grey wolves converge towards the most promising prey location. They update their positions and adapt their search based on the fitness values of the alpha, beta, and delta wolves. The updating stage involves adjusting the search parameters, such as the positions and weights of the grey wolves, based on the best solutions found so far. GWO has demonstrated effectiveness in solving various optimization problems, including function optimization, engineering design, and parameter estimation. Its ability to emulate the hunting behavior and social hierarchy of grey wolves contributes to its exploration-exploitation balance and efficient convergence. Overall, Grey Wolf Optimizer offers a nature-inspired algorithm that harnesses the collaborative hunting strategies observed in grey wolf packs. By combining exploration, cooperation, and adaptive updating mechanisms, GWO provides a promising approach for solving optimization problems.
